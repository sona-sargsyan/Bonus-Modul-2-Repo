For tonight's performance of the The Sound of Silence
Join us on the stage
To be the odd Garfunkel to my Paul Simon tonight
Please welcome mister Myles Kennedy
Now fire up those lighter and cellphone
And hold them it up in the air people, now it's the time

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
